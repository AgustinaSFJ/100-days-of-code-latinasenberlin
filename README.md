# 100-days-of-code-latinasenberlin
Challenge, from scratch to something. This is my first time on the programming path. I am going to do an hour every day during 100 days and we will see what I can learn. I have the support of a group of women in technology, currently all in Berlin.

## day one
*Progreso de mi día*: Investigué acerca de Github, creé la cuenta, aprendí a hacer un "Readme" y leí algo sobre  Markdown.
